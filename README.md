This project represents the robust server-side architecture for a full-stack application built with Node.js and the Express.js framework, designed to support comprehensive user authentication. It integrates a suite of middleware—including Morgan for logging, Body-Parser for handling data, and Cookie-Parser/Express-Session for session management—to create a functional backend. The application uses Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database and employs Passport.js with Connect-Flash to facilitate secure user login and registration processes. Upon successful database connection, the application loads defined routes to handle web requests and manages user sessions securely, ultimately listening for traffic on a specific port.
